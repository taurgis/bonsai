# Site Import/Export in B2C Commerce

The site.xsd schema file describes the structure of data that is exported from an instance to a zip file, or imported from a .zip file. The site.xsd file describes all site-related data and global, non-site-related data (that is, organization-level data, such as shipping methods). This topic applies to B2C Commerce.

Note Don't use special characters, such as umlauts, in file names—including names of image files—because doing so causes site import/export to fail.

Site export exports certain objects (including database objects and static files) and stores them in a single .zip file, which is available for download. You can upload the zip file to another instance and import it there. Site import is possible only if there’s no custom site in the instance.

Note Code (cartridges) isn't part of the Site import/export and requires separate handling.

To access Site Import Export, click App Launcher ![App Launcher](https://sf-zdocs-cdn-prod.zoominsoftware.com/tdta-b2c_merchandiser_administrator-2-production-enus/__asset_version__/images/appLauncher.png), and then select **Administration** | **Site Development** | **Site Import & Export**.

Use Site Import/Export as follows:

| Mode | Purpose | Included Data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Import | Initial Instance Setup. You can "clone" an instance. This approach is most helpful during development to initialize a developer's instance or a testing instance. (Use Site Import to set up an initial "staging" instance, but then the import won’t be used again in a primary instance group.) | Initial global data (site independent) such as:Global preferences as locales, instance time zonesGlobal custom objectsSchedulesSystem object attribute extensionsCustom object typesCustom preference type definitionsCatalogs and price booksSite data including business objects as:Custom objectsContent library, assets, and imagesCustomer groupsCustomer listsShipping, tax and payment configurationInventoryStoresSite preferencesSearch configurationSource CodesSite relations data such as Catalog-Site assignments |
| Export | Archiving Instance Data | All instance data comprising all sites and corresponding business objects and global data is exported. |
| Export | Particular Instance Data | Selective site and instance data:Sites (including individual types of site-specific data to export)Libraries / Library Static ResourcesCatalogs / Catalog Static ResourcesPrice BooksInventory ListsCustomer ListsGlobal data (Custom Objects, Attribute Definitions, Custom Preferences, Schedules, Custom Quota Settings) |
| Export/ import | Copying an entire Instance | B2C Commerce customization projects often involve several development teams working in parallel on different development instances. The Site import/export lets them share instance configurations and data across multiple instances.Site import/export lets them save a snapshot (configuration and data) of an instance and restore it on the same or another instance. This feature can also be used for instance configuration versioning. |
| Export/ import | Copying specific site data for testing | When testing new code or troubleshooting a problem, it can be necessary to export data from a production instance to import it on a developer sandbox. However, it isn't desirable to import all of the site's data, either because of the size of the site or because of privacy concerns around customer data. In this case use the export feature to export only the site-specific data you want and import it into your sandbox. |

_Granularity:_ selected sites.

Other information you must know about Site Import/Export:

*   The Site Import/Export function in the Business Manager uses standard Business Manager imports/exports for some of its object types; so some XML files use the same schema within Site Export .zip files.
*   Site Export also supports some object types excluded from the standard import/export functionality (for example, schedules and site preferences).
*   It isn't possible to trigger a Site Import programmatically.
*   A catalog and a site can be exported without the static content being included in the resulting archive file. This behavior allows users more granular control over the export process. This behavior is also important because the size of the archive files rapidly exceeds the WebDAV file size limitation when images are included.
*   Compatibility of the import/export format is ensured for the same B2C Commerce version only.
*   The list of custom cartridges used for Business Manager is supported in the site import/export. The file preferences.xml, which contains global preferences, includes the additional preference identified by the key "CustomCartridges".
*   Use the site export function in Business Manager to export a catalog and a site without the static content being included in the resulting archive file. This change provides more granular control over the export process. This change is also important because the size of the archive files rapidly exceeds the WebDAV file size limitation when images are included.

## Site Export File Consistency in B2C Commerce

The Catalog, Customers, Inventory, and Access Roles site export files are created consistently, exported in sorted order. This behavior makes sure that a diff of XML feeds is guaranteed to reveal data changes and differences. Developers work in a collaborative environment, working with and changing a common site import definition. Thus, exports provide the only way to compare the content of two instances. This topic applies to B2C Commerce.

*   The customer file is sorted by address ID in ascending alphabetical order
*   The access roles file is sorted in ascending alphabetical order based on the _resource path_ of an access control element. If the resource paths of two access control elements are the same, it then sorts by the permission.
*   The Inventory file is sorted in ascending alphabetical order based on product ID.
*   The catalog file is sorted by the following rules (in the following order):

| Element | Sort order |
| --- | --- |
| Categories | Depth-first recursive ordering. Sibling categories are ordered by position. Unsorted categories appear at end of list ordered by name. Example: Root, JA, JB, JC, K, KA, KB, |
| Category refinement definitions | Sorted by position |
| Category refinement bucket definitions | Sorted by position |
| Category product attribute groups | Sorted by position |
| Category product attributes | Sorted by position |
| Category links | Sorted by position |
| Products | Sorted by SKU |
| Product bundled products | Sorted by position |
| Product retail set products | Sorted by position |
| Product product set products | Sorted by position |
| Product options | Sorted by position |
| Product links | Sorted by position |
| Product variation attributes | Sorted by position |
| Product variations | Sorted by position |
| Shared product options | Sorted by ID |
| Shared product option values | Sorted by position |
| Shared variation attributes | Sorted by ID |
| Shared variation attribute values | Sorted by position |
| Category assignments | Ordered by category name, then position (unsorted products at end), then product SKU |
| Recommendations | Ordered by sourcetype, sourceid, targettype, typecode, position |
| For all business objects: Custom attributes | Sorted alphabetically by ID across all attribute groups |

## Site Export Archive Structure

Description of the structure on which the .zip file is based. The export process creates this directory structure within the archive. If a selective export with a subset of data is started, a fragmented structure according to the data units selected is created. A site import parses the archive and expects the exact same structure. This topic applies to B2C Commerce.

### Preferences.xml

## Use Site Import/Export to Import Reference Application Demo Sites in B2C Commerce

Import B2C Commerce reference application demo sites into a sandbox. Demo sites are prebuilt and enable you to explore storefront functionality. Unlike custom sites, demo sites don’t need to be exported from other instances. They can be immediately imported into sandboxes. This topic applies to B2C Commerce.

There are two demo sites:

*   Storefront Reference Architecture (SFRA) Demo Sites: When you import an SFRA demo site, Business Manager shows a list of available demo configurations. Each demo configuration is a combination of site data and feature code that you can import into the sandbox. To select the demo configuration that you want, read the descriptions provided in the list. When you import a demo configuration, Business Manager:
    *   Imports the configuration's site data into your sandbox.
    *   Uploads the configuration’s cartridges and code into a unique code version directory.
    *   Automatically activates the code version directory. (Each configuration has its own unique code version directory.)
    *   Search indexes are automatically updated.
*   SiteGenesis (SGJC) Demo Site: When you import the SGJC demo site, Business Manager imports the site data only. You upload code separately. Search indexes aren’t automatically updated.

![Note](https://sf-zdocs-cdn-prod.zoominsoftware.com/tdta-b2c_merchandiser_administrator-2-production-enus/__asset_version__/images/icon_note.png)

Note When you import a demo site, you import data (and code) that can be older than the data and code in the associated git repositories.

### Import the Storefront Reference Architecture (SFRA) Demo Site

You can import the SFRA demo site using Business Manager.
