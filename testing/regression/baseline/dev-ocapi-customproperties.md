Custom Properties

Attention!

**The Open Commerce API (OCAPI) is now deprecated.** The provisions described in our [versioning and deprecation policy](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-commerce-ocapi/versioninganddeprecationpolicy.html) fully apply. For all new projects and major refactoring work, use B2C Commerce API (SCAPI) as the default REST API. For additional details, refer to [Why Use SCAPI Instead of OCAPI](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/commerce-api/guide/why-use-scapi.html).

The Open Commerce API allows you to set custom properties of business objects in input documents and to read custom properties in output documents. Whether a business object supports custom properties can be found in the [tables below](#document-types-supporting-custom-properties). Custom properties are always marked with the prefix `c_` and have therefore their own namespace.

## Custom Properties Example 

The example below shows a document response including some custom properties in OCAPI:

```txt
REQUEST: GET /dw/shop/v24_5/products/creative-zen-v HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/json

RESPONSE: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type:  application/json; charset=UTF-8
Cache-Control:  max-age=900,must-revalidate
{
   ...
   "c_mediaFormat" : [ "0010", "0020", "0030", "0040" ],
   "c_memorySize" : "1GB",
   "c_tabDescription" : "The ZEN V player was designed for people like you those who walk a step or two ahead of the pack."
}
```

## Custom Properties Value Types 

The following value types are supported in OCAPI for input and output of custom properties.

*   Text
*   String
*   Enum of Strings
*   Set of Strings
*   Integer
*   Enum of Integers
*   Set of Integers
*   Double
*   Set of Doubles
*   Boolean
*   EMail
*   Password
*   Date
*   Date+Time

Note

The value types **HTML** and **Image** are only supported as output, but not as input value type for custom properties in OCAPI.

## Document Types Supporting Custom Properties 

The tables below lists the document types that support custom properties in OCAPI SHOP and DATA APIs. OCAPI `modify...` hooks that used the referenced document types can add custom properties using the `c_` prefix. See [Customization With Hooks](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/commerce-api/guide/extensibility_via_hooks.html), [Hooks for SHOP API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-commerce-ocapi/hooks-shop.html), and [Hooks for DATA API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/references/b2c-commerce-ocapi/hooks-data.html) for more information.
