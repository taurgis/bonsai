# Create a Role in B2C Commerce

A role is a named group of permissions. For example, group all of the permissions related to catalog management into a role called Catalog Manager. Next, assign this role to the user whose job it is to manage the catalog. This topic applies to B2C Commerce.

The SiteGenesis application contains several roles predefined for your convenience, such as the Administrator role. You can import and export these roles. Use the roles without modification or customize them to suit your application needs. If necessary, remove the roles and create your own set of roles. Make sure you grant at least one user with access to the Roles and Permissions module.

To manage roles and permissions, you must have permissions to the Roles & Permissions module. To add a user and to manage user login and credential information, you must have permissions to the Users module. To assign or unassign roles to users, you must have permissions to both the Users module and the Roles & Permissions module.

If you don't have a user with access to the Roles and Permissions module, contact B2C Commerce Support to reinstate access to this module.

Note A list of assigned roles also appears on the Roles page of a user definition.

1.  Click App Launcher ![App Launcher](https://sf-zdocs-cdn-prod.zoominsoftware.com/tdta-b2c_merchandiser_administrator-2-production-enus/__asset_version__/images/appLauncher.png), and then select **Administration** | **Organization** | **Roles & Permissions**.

    Roles marked with a yellow triangle are security-sensitive. They have permission to manage users or access roles or both. Use care when changing these roles so you don't give access privileges to the wrong users.

2.  Click **New**.
3.  On the General tab, define or edit general information and click **Apply**.

    A role's ID is limited to:

    *   letters (including non-Latin)
    *   numbers
    *   whitespace
    *   special characters: `_ ! " & \ ' ( ) + - . , / : < > ? @ [ ]`

    B2C Commerce rejects IDs with not-allowed characters; the access role can't be created or imported.

4.  On the Users tab, select users and click **Assign**.

    To use the Users tab to assign users to a role, you must also have permissions to the Users module.

## Assign Business Manager Module Permissions

## Assign WebDAV Permissions

When selecting a WebDAV permission ending with an asterisk ('/catalogs/\*', '/libraries/\*' or '/dynamic/\*') or '(all other folders)', the permission is granted for all future subfolders automatically. To prevent this behavior check the sub-permissions manually.

## Assign a Price Adjustment Limit

Assign limits per user for manual price adjustments in Business Manager. You can select a context of one, multiple, or all sites for which the limits apply.

### Required Editions

Access limits programmatically via the Script API, `dw.order.LineItemCtnr.verifyPriceAdjustmentLimits()`.

A price adjustment limits violation check is done during manual price adjustment creation by Open Commerce API (OCAPI), as follows:

```
POST /baskets/\{basket_id\}/price_adjustments
```

Price adjustment limits are imported and exported through the site import/export.

1.  Click App Launcher ![App Launcher](https://sf-zdocs-cdn-prod.zoominsoftware.com/tdta-b2c_merchandiser_administrator-2-production-enus/__asset_version__/images/appLauncher.png), and then select **Administration** | **Organization** | **Roles and Permissions** > and select Administrator.
2.  On the **Price Adjustment Limits** tab, select the context in which you want to assign permissions.
3.  Click **Apply**.
4.  To add a limit, click **Add**.
5.  On the Add Price Adjustment Limit window, select a type (Item, Shipping, or Order), a currency, and a value.

    Price adjustment limits validation considers only the access roles with price adjustment [permissions](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/b2c-commerce/guide/b2c-setting-permissions-for-csc.html) configured. Only price adjustment limits that are assigned to an access role with a specific type of price adjustment permission are considered when a manual price adjustment is validated. The type of price adjustment permission, item, order, or shipping, depends on the type of the manual price adjustment. To prevent all users with access to a role from creating unlimited manual item price adjustments, define price adjustment limits to access roles with an item, order, or shipping price adjustment permission.

6.  To change the context, click **Select Context**.

    When you change context from one to multiple sites, for example, you can see unassigned limits.

7.  To assign a limit, check the box next to the limit and click **Update**.
8.  To unassign a limit, clear the box next to the limit and click **Update**.
9.  To revert changes, click **Revert** before you click **Update**.

    When you click **Update**, your changes can't be reverted.
